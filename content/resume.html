    <i>Machine Learning Engineer Contractor (prev. Intern)</i> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a machine learning solution for a system that automatically detects, crops, and uploads student work directly from their
            webcam feed. 
        <li>Work included creating a <code>docs-60k</code> dataset of documents in natural backgrounds by curating from multiple existing datasets, fine tuning an instance of DeepLabV3 on PyTorch while using Weights and Biases for MLOps and optimization, and then preparing the model for edge device client-side deployment through quantization-aware training and using ONNX runtime web with React.js.

<h2>Competition-Extracurriculars-Projects</h2>
<span class="title">2023 Citadel Datathon Midwest Regional - ðŸ¥‡(1st)</span>
<div class="desc">
    <div class="dates">Feb. 2023</div>
    <i>1<sup>st</sup> place team</i>
    <ul>
        <li>Came in first in the Midwest Regional for Citadelâ€™s 2023 Datathon. Winning paper was written on the environmental (and consequently health-related) effects of greenspaces and bluespaces, in particular on surface temperatures and air quality index through programmatic time series analysis, using metrics such as the Dicky-Fuller test, and providing strong evidence of data correlation through K-means segmentation and heuristic minima discovery.
    </ul>

<span class="title">2022 William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Exam - Top 25%</span>
<div class="desc">
    <div class="dates">Dec. 2022</div>
    <i>1000<sup>th</sup> out of ~4,000 </i>
    <ul>
        <li> Scored a 9/120<sup>[1]</sup> on the 2022 Putnam Exam, a score which is just under the top 1000, about the 75th percentile overall.

<span class="title">2022 UChicago Mathematics REU</span>
<div class="desc">
    <div class="dates">Jun. 2023 - Aug. 2023</div>
    <i>Paid Participant </i>
    <ul>
        <li> Attended the UChicago Mathematics REU, a competitive program for undergraduates to spend 8 weeks emulating the graduate mathematics research process under the supervision of a mentor. The final paper, <i>Mean Field Games and Weak Solutions</i>, written on the topic of stochastic mean field games, a natural topic that forms from optimal control of the Fokker-Planck equation, which concerns the optimization of the actions of a small agent compared to a large population. In particular, we consider the system $$
            \begin{cases}
            \partial_t u + H(x,D_xu, D_x^2u, m) = 0\\
            \partial_t m + \operatorname{div}(H(D_pHm))-\partial_{ij}(D_{M_{ij}}H(D_pHm)) = 0\\
            \end{cases} \quad \text{subject to} \quad
            \begin{cases} 
            u(x,T) = \psi(x, \theta(\cdot, T))\\
            m(x,0) = m_0(x)
            \end{cases}
